Azure Active Directory
	Cloud-Based identity and access management service. 
	Manage users, Sign-Ins and access to AD-related resources

Domain
	A domain is an area of a network organized by a single authentication database
	An Active Directory Domain is a logical grouping of AD objects on a network 

Domain Controller (DC)
	A domain controller is a server that authenticates users identities and authorizes their access to resources 
	
Domain Computer
	A computer that is registered wiht a central authentication database A domain computer would be an AD Object 
	
AD Object
	An AD Object is the basic element of Active Directory such as: 
		Users, Groups, Printers, Shared Folders

Group Policy Object
	A virtual collection fo policy settings. It controls what AD objects have access to. 
	
Organization Units (OU)
	A subdivision within Active Directory into which you can place users, groups, computers, and other organizational units. 
	
Directory Service
	A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. A Directory service on a Domain Controller
	
Azure AD - Tenant
	A tenant represents an organization in Azure Active Directory
	A tenant is a dedicated Azure AD Server Instance 
	A tenant is automatically created when you sign up for either
		Microsoft Azure
		Microsoft Intue
		Microsoft 365

Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
	Azure Active Direcotry Domain Services (AD DS) provides managed domain service such as: 
		Domain Joins
		Group Policies
		LDAP (Lightweight Directory access protocol)
		Kerberos / NTLM Authentication
		
Azure AD Connect 
	Azure AD Connect is a hybrid service to connect your on-premise Active Directory to your Azure Account
	Azure AD Connect allows for seamless Single Sign On from your on-premise workstation to Microsoft Azure 
	Azure AD Connect has the following features: 
		
		Password hash synchronization - sign-in method, synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD passwords with Azure AD
		
		Pass-through authentication - sign-in method, allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud
		
		Federation Integration - hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure, for certificate renewal
		
		Synchronization - Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects, ensures on-prem and cloud data matches
		
		Health Monitoring - robust monitoring and provides a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity
		
Active Directory - Users
	Users represent an identity for a person or employee in your domain. A user has logon credentials and can use them to log into the Azure Portal 
		You can assign roles and administrative roles to users 
		You can add users to groups 
		You can enforce authentication methods such as (MFA) 
		You can track users sign ins 
		Track devices user's login from and allow or deny devices 
		Assign Microsoft licenses
		
		Azure AD has two kinds of users: 
			Users - A user belongs to your organization
			Guest Users - A guest user belongs to another organization
		
Azure AD Groups	
	Groups - lets the resource owner (of Azure directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group, instead of having to provide the rights one-by-one. 
	Groups contain: 
		Owners - Has permissions to add and remove members 
		Members - Have permissions to do things 
	Assignment 
		You can assign roles directly to a group 
		You can assign applications directly to a group
		
		Request to Join Groups
			The group owner can let userse find their own groups to join, instead of assigning them. The owner can also set up the group to automatically accept all users that joinor to require approval. 	
		
Azure AD - Assign Access Rights
	There are four ways to assign resource access rights to yoru users: 
		Direct Assignment - The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource
		Group Assignment - The resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which automatically gives all of the group members acceess to the resource 
		
		Rule-based Assignment - The resource owner creates a group and uses a role to define which users are assigned to a specific resource
		 
		 External Authority Assignment - Accesss comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app. 
		 
Azure AD - External Identities 
	External Identities in Azure AD, allow people outside your organization to access your apps and resources, while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer.
		
		Supports logins from Google and Facebook
		Share Apps with external users (B2B COllaboration)
		Develop Apps intended for other Azure AD tenants (single tenant or multi tentant) 
		Develop white-labeled apps for consumers and customers (Azure AD B2C) 
	
Azure AD - Device Management 
	What is Device Identify Management? 
		The management of a physical devices such as phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers, that are granted access to company resources such as Printers, Cloud Resources via device-based Conditional Access. 	
	
		For companies with a distributed workforce, that allows remote employedes and employees who are allowed use their own personal equipment (Bring Your Own Device).
		
		A company needs a way to protect their organization's assets such as access to cloud resoures across those devices where they have less control over the physical securities of the work environment.

Azure Policies - Azure Policy Definition File
	Display Name - Identifies the policy (128 character limit) 
	Type (read only )
		Built in - maintained by Michaelsoft 
		Custom - Created by you
		Static - Microsoft Owned, A regulatory Compliance
	Description - Provides the context of the policy 
	Metadata - Optional key value information to store on the policy
	Mode - Determines which resource types are evaluated. Changes whether using resource provider or Azure Resource Manager 
		Resource Manager 
			All - resource groups, subscriptions and all resource types
			Indexed - only resource types that support tags and location
		Resource Provider
			Microsoft.ContainerService.Data
			Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data
			Microsoft.KeyVault.Data
		Parameters - Values you can pass into the policy to allow the policy to be more flexible. A parameter has the following properties 
			Name - the name of the parametere 
			Type - string, array, object, boolean, integer, float or datetime
			Metadata - used by azure to display friendly information
				description
				display name 
				strong type 
				assign permissions
			defaultvalue
			allowevalues
	Policy Rule
		consists of an if and then blocks. In the if block, you define one or more conditions that specify when the policy is enforced. You can apply logical operators to these conditions to precisely define the scenario for a policy 
		Deny - the resource creation / update fails due to policy
		Audit - Creates a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant resource but it doesn't stop the request 
		Append - Adds additional parameters/ fields to the requested resource during creation or update. A common example is adding tags on resources such as Cost Center or specifying allowec IPs for a storage resource. 
		Audit if not exists - creates a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant resource, but it doesn't stop the request 
		Deploy if not exists - Executes a template deployment when specific condition is met. for example if SQL encryption is enabled on a database, then it can run a template after the DB is created to set it up a specific way. 
		Disabled - The policy is ignored (disabled). Oftern used for testing 
		
		
Azure Resource Manager - Azure Resource Manager 
	A deployment and management service for Azure
	Enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your azure account
Azure Resource Manager - Introduction
	Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a service that allows you to manager Azure resources
		Azure Resource Manager is a collection of services in the Azure Portal, so you can't simply type in "Azure Resource Manager" 
	It is a management layer that allows you to: 
		Create, Update, Delete Resources
		Apply Management features eg. Access Controls, Locks, Tags
		Writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via JSON templates. 
			The specific features we are going to look at that make up ARM layer are the following: 
				Subscriptions
				Management Groups
				Resource Groups
				Resource Providers 
				Resource Locks
				Azure Blueprints
				Resources Tags
				Access Control 
				Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) 
				Azure Policies 
				ARM Templates 
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Use Case
	Think of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) as a gate keeper. 
	All requests flow through ARM and it decides whether that request can be performed on a resource. 
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Scoping
	What is scope? 
	Scope is a boundary of control for azure resources. it is a way to governyou resource by placing resources 
		within a logical grouping 
		and also applying a logical restriction in the form of rules 
		
	Management Groups - A logical grouping of multiple subscriptions 
		Subsciptions - grants you access to Azure services based on a billing and support agreement
			Resource Groups - a logical grouping of multiple resources 
				Resources - an azure service eg. Azure VM's 
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Subscriptions
	Before you can do anything in your Azure account. You'll need to have a subscription. An Azure Account can have multiple subscriptions and the most common three are: 
		Free Trial 
		Pay as you go 
		Azure for Students 
	At the subscription level you'll have the ability to set: 
		Resource Tags
		Access Controls
		Resource Groups
		
		
Azure Resource Manager - Management Groups
	Managing multiple subscriptions (accounts) into a hierarchal structure. 
	Each directory is given a single top level management group called the "root" management group
	All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Groups
	Resource Groups - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution
	Resource - A manageable item that is available through Azure 
	Resourece Provider - A service that supplies Azure resources
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Providers
	Resource Providers - In order to use Azure resources you have to register Resourec Providers
	Many Resource Providers are registered by default for you with you Subscription
	You can register resource providers under your subscription
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Tags
	A tag is a key and value pair that you can assign to azure resources. 
		Tags allow you to organize your resources in the following ways: 
			Resource management 
				Specific workloads, environments eg. Developer environments 
			Cost management and optimization
				Cost tracking, budgets, alerts 
			Operations Managment 
				Business commitments and SLA operations eg. Mission critical services 
			Security 
				Classification of data and security impact
			Governance and regulatory compliance
			Automation
			Workload optimization
			
			
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Locks
	As an admin, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other userse from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. 
		In the Azure portal you can set the following lock levels 
			Cannot delete 
				authorized users can still read and modify a resource but they cant delete the resource 
			ReadOnly
				authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resources 		
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Azure Blueprints	
	Azure blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions. 
	Compose artifacts based on common organization-based patterns into re-usable blueprints. 
	The service is designed to help with environment setup
	Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as: 
		Role Assignments
		Policy Assignments 
		Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM Templates) 
		Resource Groups
			The Azure Blueprints service is backed by the globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB 
			Blueprint objects are replicated to multiple Azure regions. 
		ARM Templates vs Azure Blueprints 
			Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Azure Blueprints can be accomplished with an ARM template
			ARM Template
				ARM templateds are stored either locally or in source control
				There no active connection or relationship to the ARM template 
			Azure Blueprints 
				relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) 
		Azure Blueprints supports improved tracking and auditing of deployments 
		
		
ARM Templates - Introduction 
	What is Infrastructure as Code? (IaC) 
		the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers (eg. Azure) through machine-readable definition files (eg. JSON files) rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 
		You write a script that will setup cloud services for you. 
		IaCs can either be: 
			Declarative - You defined exactly what you want, and you get exactly that
			Imperative - You define what you generally want, and the service will guess what you want. 
	ARM Templates are JSON files that define azure resources you want to provision and azure services you want to configure 
		With ARM templates you can: 
			ARM templates are declarative: (you get exctly what you define)
			stand up, tear down or share entire architectures in minutes
			Reduce configuration mistakes 
			Know exactly what you have defined for a stack to establish an architecture baseline for compliance 
	With ARM templates you can: 
		ARM teplates are declarative. (you get exactly what you define) 
		stand up, tear down or share entire architecture in minutes
		Reduce configuration mistakes 
		Establish an architecture baseline for compliance 
		Modulatrity break up your architecture in multiple files and reuse them
		Extensibility Add Powershell and Bash scripts to your templates 
		Testing you can use the ARM template tool kit (arm-ttk)
		Preview Changes Before you create infrastructure via template, see what it will create
		Built-In Validation will only deploy your template if it passes 
		Tracked Deployments Keep track of changes to architecture over time
		Policy as Code Apply Azure policies to ensure you remain compliant
		Microsoft Blueprints (establishes relationship between resource and the template) 
		CI/CD Integration
		Exportable Code (exporting the current state of resource groups and resources)
		Authoring tools Visual Studio Code has advanced features for authoring ARM templates 
		
		
ARM Templates - Arm Template Skeleton
	Skeleton - the genreal structure of an ARM template 
	$schema - describes the properties that are avaialable within a template. 
	contentVersion - the version of the template. 
		You can provide any value for this element
	apiProfile - Use this value to avoiid having to specify API versions for each resource in the template 
	parameters - values you can pass along to your template 
	variables - you transform parameters or resource properties using function expressions
	Functions - User-defined functions available within template 
	resources - the azure resources you'll want to deploy or update 
	outputs - values that are returned after deployment 
	
	
ARM Templates - ARM Template Resources 
	Resource - An Azure Resource you want to provision
		type - type of the resources
			Follows the format of {ResourceProvider}/ResourceType
		apiVersion - Version of the REST API to use for the resource
			Each resource provider published its own API versions, 
		name - Name of the resource
		location - Most resources have a location property
			The region where the resource will be deployed
		Other Properties - Other properties we can use to configure the resource
		Will vary per resource type
		
		
ARM Templates - Parameters
	Parameters - Allows you to pass variables to your ARM template
	type - the expected data type of the inputed value 
		string,securestring, int, bool, object, securedObject, and array. 
	defaultValue is provided it will be set to this value 
	allowedValues an array of allowed values 
	minValue the minimal possible value
	maxValue the maximum length of characters or array
	minLength the maximum length of characters or array
	maxLength the maximum length of characters or array
	description the dexcription that will be displayed in the Azure Portal
	
	
ARM Templates - ARM Template Functions
	Functions - Allows you to apply transformations to your ARM variables 
		Template Functions - built-in functions 
		Used-Defined Functions - custom functions you create 
		Functions are called using parentheses eg. (): 
	Template Functions 
		Array: array, concat, contains, createaray, empty, first, intedrsection, last, length, min, max, range, skip, take, union
		Comparison: coalesce, equals, less, lessOrQuals, greater, greatOrEquals

ARM Templates - ARM Template Variables 
	Nested Variables - You can use json object to have nested variables to scope your variables for multiple use cases. 
	Scoping / Nesting variables based on environment
		"variables": {
		  "environmentSettings": {
		    "test": {
		      "instancesize": "Small", 
		      "instanceCount": 4
		    }
		  }
		}, 
	Using Params to choose the environment
		"parameters": {
		  "environmentName": { 
		    "type": "string", 
		    "allowedValues": [
		      "test", 
		      "prod"
		    ]
		  }
		},
	Referencing nested variables eg Variables()[].property
		"[variables('environmentSettings')[parameters('environmentName')].instanceSize]" 


ARM Templates - ARM Templates Outputs
	Outputs - Returns values from deployed resources, so you can use them programmatically
	You specify the type and value under outputs
		"outputs": { 
		  "resourceID": {
		    "type": "string",
		    "value": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses', parameters('publicIPAddressses_name'))]"
	You can use the Azure API via CLI, Powershell or SDK to fetch outputs 
	
	
Storage Accounts - Introduction to Storage Accounts 
	Azure Storage Accounts - Contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks
	Azure Storage offers several types of stroage accounts. 
	Each with different features and their own pricing models 
		General-purpose v1 (legacy)
		General-purpose v2
		BlobStorage (legacy)
		BlockBlobStorage
		File Stroage
	Storage Accounts vary with the following features: 
		Supported Services (What can I put in this storage account?)
			Blob, File, Queue, Table, Disk, and Data Lake Gen2
		Performance Tiers (how fast will my read and writes be?)
			Standard and Premium
		Access Tiers (how often do I need quick access to files?)
			Hot, Cool, Archive
		Replication (How many redundant copies should be made and where?)
			LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS
		Deployment Model (Who should deploy the supported services?)
			Resource Manager, Classic
			
	
Storage Accounts - Storage Comparison
	General-purpose V2 is the most common storage type aside from Blob Storage
Storage Accounts - Core Storage Services
	 Azure has 5 core storage services 
	 	Azure Blob - A massively scalable objecty store for text and binary data.
	 		Also included support for Big Data Analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen 2
	 	Azure Files - Managed file shares for on-premises deployments
	 	Azure Queues - A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components 
	 	Azure Tables - a NoSQL store for schema-less storage of structured data
	 	Azure Disks = Block level storage volumes for Azure VM's 
	 	
	 	
Storage Accounts - Performance Tiers
	Ther are 2 types of performance tiers for storage accounts: Standard and Premium 
		IOPS - stands for input / Output operations per second 
		Premium Performance
			Stored on Solid State Drives 
			Optimize for low latency
			Higher throughput
			use cases: 
				Interactive Workloads
				Analytics
				AI or ML 
				Data Transformation
			An SSD has no moving parts and data is distributed randomly. This is why it can read and write so fast 
		Standard Performance
			Stored on Hard Disk Drives 
			Varied performance based on access tier (Hot, Cool, Archive) 
			Use Cases: 
				Backup and disaster recovery
				Media Content
				Bulk Data Processing
			An HDD has moving parts, an arm that needs to read and write data sequential to a disk. It is very good at writing or reading large amounts of data that is close together. 
			
			
Storage Accounts - Access Tiers
	There are 3 types of access tiers for Standard storage: Cool, Hot and Archive
	Hot 
		Data that's accessed frequently 
		Highest storage cost, lowest access cost 
		Use Case
			Data thats in actvie use or expected to be accessed frequently 
			Data that's staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool access tier
	Cool
		Data that's infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days. 
		Lower storage cost, higher access cost
		Use Case: 
			Short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets 
			Older Media content not viewed frequently anymore but is expected to be available immediately when accessed 
			Large datasets that need to be stored cost effectively whie more data is being gathered for future processing. 
	Archive 
		Data that's rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days
		Lowest storage cost, highest access cost 
		Use Case: 
			Long-term backup, secondary backu, and archival datasets
			Original (raw) data that must be preserved, even after it has been processed into final usable form
	Account level tiering 
		Any blob that doesn't have an explicitely assigned tier infers the tier form the Storage Account access tier setting
	Blob-Level Tiering
		You can upload a blob to the tier of your choice
		Changing tiers happens instantly with the exception from moving out of archive 
	Rehydrating a blob 
		When moving a blob out of archive into another tier it can take several hours. This is known as "rehydrating" 
	Blob Lifecycle Management 
		You cna create rule based policies to transition data to different tiers Eg. After 30 days move to cool storage 
	When a blob is uploaded or moved to another tier It's charged at the new tier's rate immediately upon tier change. 
	When moving from a cooler tier: 
		The operation is billed as a write operation to the destination tier. 
		Where the write operation (per 10,000) and data write (per GB) charges of the destination tier apply 
	When moving from a hotter tier: 
		The operation is billed as a read from the tier source
		Wher the read operation (per 10,000) and data retrieval (per GB) charges of the source tier apply
		Eary deletion charges for any blob moved out of the cool or archive tier may apply as well 
	Cool and archive early deletion
		Any blob that is moved into the cool tier (GPv2 accounts only) is subject to a cool early deletion period of 30 days. 
		Any blob that is moved into the archive tier is subject to an archive early deletion period of 180 days. This charge is prorated. 
		
		
Storage Accounts - Replication Data Redundancy
	When you create a Storage account you need to choose a Replication type
	Replication stores multiple copies of your datra so that it is protected from: 
		planned events 
		transient hardware failures 
		network or power outages 
		massive natural disasters 
	Primary Region Redundancy 
		Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) 
		Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) 
	Secondaary Region Redundancy 
		Geo-redundant storage (GRS) 
		Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS) 
	Secondary Region Rendundancy with Read Access
		Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) 
		Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)
		
		
Storage Accounts - LRS ZRS
	Redundancy in the Primary Region
		Data is replicated 3 times in the primary region
		There are two options for storing in the primary region
			Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
				Copies data synchronously in primary region

Storage Accounts - Introduction to Azure Blob
	Blob storage is an object-store that is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. 
	Unstructured data is dat taht doesn't adhere to particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. 
		Azure blobs are composed of the components:
			Storage account 
			FQDN 
			Containers (similar to a folder in a file system) 
			Blobs - the actual data being stored 3
			
			
Storage Accounts - Azure Blob Types 
	Azure Storage supports 3 typs of blobs: 
		Block blobs
			store text and binary data 
			made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually 
			store up to about 4.75 TiB of data 
		Append blobs 
			Optimized for append operations
			Ideal for scenarios such as loggind data from a virtual machine 
		Page blobs 
			store random access files up to 8TB in size 
			store virtual hard drive (VHD) files and serve as disks for Azure virtual machines
			
			
Storage Accounts - Azure Blob Moving Data
	There are multiple ways to move data into Azure Blob Storage 
		AzCopy - Easy to use comand line tool for windows and linux 
		Azure Storage Data Movement library - .NET library (uses AzCopy underneath) 
		Azure Data Factory - (An ETL service by Azure) 
		Blobfuse - Virtual file system driver. access data through linux file system
		Azure Data Box - A rugged device used to physically transport data to Azure 
		Azure Import / Export Service - A service where you ship your physical disks for data transfer onto Azure 
		
		
Storage Accounts - Introduction to Azure Files
	Azure Files is a fully managed file share in the cloud 
	A file share is a centralized server for storage that allows multiple connections. 
		Its like having one big shared drive that everyone (Virtual Machines) can work on at the same time
	To connnect to the file share a network protocol is used: 
		Server Message Block (SMB) 
		Network File System (NFS) 
	When a connection is established the file share's filesystem will be accessible in the specific directory within your own directory tree. This is known as mounting. 
	
	
Storage Accounts - Azure Files Use Cases 
	Use Cases
		Completely replace or supplement on-premises file servers Network Attach Storage (NAS) devices
			Lift-and-Shift means when you move workloads without rearchitecting, eg. importing local VMs to the cloud
			Classic Lift - where both the application and its data are moved to Azure 
			Hybrid Lift - where the application data is moved to Azure Files, and the application continues to run on-premises
		Simplify cloud development
			Shared application settings - Multiple VMs and developer workstations need to access the same config files 
			Diagnostic share - All VMs log to file share, developers can mount and debug all logs in a centralized place
			Dev/Test/Debug - Quickly share tools for developer needed for local environments
		Containerization
			You can use Azure Files to persist volumes for stateful containers
		Why use Azure files instead of setting up your own File server? 
			Shared Access - Already setup to work with standard networking protocols SMB anad NFS 
			Fully Managed - Its kept up to date with security patches, designed to scale
			Scripting and Tooling - You can automate the management and creation of file shared with Azure API Powershell
			Resiliency - Build to be durable and always working  
			
			
Storage Accounts - Azure Files Feature
	Backups 
		You can backup your file share with shared snapshots
			They are read-only 
			Incremental - (they only contain as much data as has chaged since the previous snapshot)
			You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share
			you can retain backups for up to 10 years 
			Backups are stored within your file share (if you delete your file share you will delete your backups)
		Soft Delete 
			You can prevent accidental deletion by turning on Soft Delete (Storage will be marked for deletion and retained for a period of time before final delete occurs
		Advanced Threat Protection
			An additional layer of security intelligence that provides alerts when it detects anomalous activity on your storage account 
		Store Tiers
			Premium - Store on to SSD with single-digit milliseconds for most IO operation
			Transaction Optimized - Store on HDD with transaction heavy workloads that don't need the latency offered by premium file shares (historically this tier has been called standard) 
			Hot - ooptimized for general purpose file sharing scenarios such as team share and Azure File Sync
			Cool - Stored on HDD for cost-efficient storage optimized for online archive storage scenario
	Types of Storage 
		General purpose version 2 (GPv2) - deployed on to HDD
		FileStorage - deployed onto SSD
	Identity 
		On-Premise - Azure Storage can be joined to an on-premise Active Directroy Domain Service
		Managed - Azure Storage can be joined to Microsoft managed active directory domain service 
		Store Account Key - A username (storage account name) and password (account key) can be used to mount 
	Networking 
		Azure Files are accessible inside or outside your AWS Account from anywhere via storage account public endpoint. 
		SMB Connects to port 445, your organization may need to unblock this port so you can mount your file share. 
	Encryption
		Azure Files is encrypted-at-rest using Azure Storage Encryption (SSE) 
		
		
Storage Accounts - Azure File Sync
	Azure File Sync is a service that allows you to cache Azure file shares on an on-premises Windows Server or cloud VM. 
		You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS
		You can have as many caches as you need across the world
		
		 
Storage Accounts - Azure Storage Explorer
	A standalone app that makes it easy to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 
		You can create Blob containers, upload files, create snapshots of Disk, and more. 
		
		
Storage Accounts - AZCopy
	AZCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account. 
		Its an executable file you download 
		you will need to have the level of authorization via attached roles
			To download 
				storage blob data reader 
			To upload
				Storage Blob Data Container 
				Storage Blob Data Owner
		You gain access either via 
				Azure Active Directory (AD) 
				Shared Access Signature (SAS) 
		Use the Copy command to upload and download	
		
			
Storage Accounts - Azure Import Export Service
	Used to securely import large amounts of data to Azure Blob storage and Azure Files by shipping disk drives to an Azure DataCenter 
		You have 2 options for shipping drives opn import: 
			Use your own disk drives 
			Use Microsoft provided drives 
				Microsoft ships up to 5 encrypted solid-state disk drives (SSDs) known as Azure Data Box Disks with a 40TB total capacity per order, to your datacenter through a regional carrier. 
			You can quickly configure Azure Data Box Disk drives, copy data to disk drives over USB 3.0 connection, and ship the disk drives back to Azure. 
		To prepare your drive you'll need to use the command-line WAImport Export tool to 
			Prepare your disk drives that are shipped for import. 
			Copying your data to the drive 
			Encrypts the data on the dirve with AES-256 bit Bitlocker. 
			Generate the drive journal files used during import creation
			Helps Identify numbers of drives needed for export jobs 
		There are two versions of WAImportExport 
			Version 1 for import/export into Azure Blob storage. 
			Version 2 for importing data into Azure files
		WAImportExport tool is  only compatible with 64-bit Windows. 
		Once you have prepared your drives and generated a journal file you can create an Import Job
			The journal file stores basic informtion such as: 
				drive serial numbers 
				encryption key
				storage account details
			you'll specify Region and Storage Account 
			You'll provide shipping information
			For expert jobs you can 
				you can only export form Azure Blob 
				you can ship up to 10 empty drives to Azure per job
				You create an export job and the data is loaded onto those drives and shipped back to you  
				
				 
Storage Accounts - SAS
	A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resoureces. 
		Share the URI to gratnt clients temporary access to specific set of permissions
	Types of shared access signatures
		Account-level SAS
			access to resources in one or more of the storage services 
		Service-level SAS 
			access to single the storage account by using the storage account key
		User delegation SAS 
			Access to storage account using Azure AD credentials
			Limited only to Blob and Containers 
			Microsoft considers this method best practice for accessing via SAS 
	A shared access signature comes into different formats 
		Ad hoc SAS 
			the start time, expiry time, and permissions are part of the URI 
			Any type of SAS can be an ad hoc SAS 
		Service SAS with stored access policy 
			A stored access policy is defined on a resource container (limited to blob container, table, queue, or file share) 
			The stored access policy can be associated to multiple SAS to manage constraints 
	The URI Format Itself
		Blob URI: https://myaccount.blob.core.windows
		sv (Storage services version) which version of the storage services to use 
		st (start time) the time SAS becomes valid 
		se (Expiration time) the time when the SAS becomes invalid eg. Container (c) or blob (b) 
		sr (Storage Resource) if the resource is a  blob, queue 
		sp (permissions) what operations can be performed against the storage resource eg. Read (r) and Write (w)
		sig (Signature) used to authenticate access to a SHA256 algorithm
		You can generate SAS via 
			Azure SDK 
			Azure Portal 
			
			
Virtual Machines - Introduction 
	Choose an OS, Compute, Memory and Storage and launch a server in minutes 
	Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) is a highly configurable server
	Virtualization let you run a server without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it
		Virtual Machines still require maintenance such as: 
			applying OS system patches 
			Installing and configuring packages 
		Some things you should know: 
			The size of the virtual machine is determined by the image 
				The image defines the combination of vCPUs, Memory and Storage Capacity
			The current limit on a per subscription basis is 20 VMs per region. 
			Azure VMs are billed at an hourly rate
			A single INstance VMs has an availability of 99.9% (when all storage disks are premium) 
			Two instances deployed in Availability Set will give you 99.95% availability  
			You can attach multiple Managed disk to your Azure VMs
	When you launch an Azure Virtual Mahcine other networking components will be created or associated to your Virtual Machine 
		Network Security Group (NSG) - attached to the NIC, virtual firewall with rules around ports and protocols 
		Network Interface (NIC) - a device that handle ip protocols and network communications
		Virtual Machine Instance - The actual running server 
		Public IP Address - The address that you will use publicly access your VM
		Virtual Network (VNet) - The network where your VM will reside
		
		
Virtual Machines - Operating Systems
	What is an Operating System? 
		The OS is the program that manageds all other programs in a computer 
		The most commonly known operating systems are Windows, macOS and Linux 
		When you launch a Virtual Machine you need to choose an image which has a specific Operating System
	Microsoft works closely with partners to ensure that images available are updated and optimized for an Azure runtime. Most of these images can be found in the Azure Marketplace. 
		SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 
		Red Hat Enterprise Linux
		Ubuntu Server 
		Debian 
		FreeBSD
		Azure Marketplace - Flatcar Container Linux
		RancherOS
		Bitnami Library for Azure 
		Mesosphere DC/OS on Azure 
		Docker Images 
		CloudBees Jenkins Platform
	You can Bring your own linux by creating a Linux Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) 
		(Hyper-V virtual hard disk (VHDX) format isn't supported in Azure, only fixed VHD)
		
		
Virtual Machines - Cloud Init
	Cloud-Init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. 
	it is supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations. 
	What is Cloud Instance Initialization? 
		The process of preparing an instance with configuration data for the operating system and runtime environment. 
			Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data: 
				Meta-data
				User-data
				Vendor-data
	User Data is a script that you want to run when an instance first boots up. eg. Install Apache web-server
	
	
Virtual Machines - Sizes
	Azure VMs come in a variety of sizes that are also optimized for specific use cases
	Azure VMs are grouped into: 
		Types eg. General Purposes, Compute Optimized
		Sizes eg. B, Dsv3 (also called Series or SKU family)
	General Purpose - Balanced CPU to memory ratio. testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers 
		SKU's - B, Dsv3, Dasv4, Dav4, DSv2, Dv2, Av2, DC, DCv2, Dv4, Ddv4, Ddsv4
	Compute Optimized - High CPU to memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and app servers
		SKU's - F, Fs, Fsv2
	Memory Optimized - High memory to CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. 
		SKU's - Esv3, Ev3, Easv4, Eav4, Ev4, Esv4, Edv4, Edsv4, Mv2, M, DSv2, Dv2
	Storage Optimized - High disk througput and IO ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL Databases, data waerhousing, and large transactional databases 
		SKU's - Lsv2
	GPU - Specialized VMs for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. 
		Available with single or multigpu's 
		SKU's - NC, NCv2, NCv3, NCasT4_v3 (Preview), ND, NDv2 (Preview), NV, NVv3 NVv4
	High performance compute - Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-througput network interfaces (RDMA) 
		SKU's - HB, HBv2, HC, H 
	The type of image may limit you to specific VM sizes 
	You can explore sizes and then sort and filter based on a variety of options such as cost
	
		
Virtual Machines - ACUs
	Azure Compute Unit (ACU) provides a way of comparing compute (CPU) performace across Azure SKU's 
	ACU is currently standardized on a Small (Standard_A1) VM with the value of 100
	All other SKU's then represent approximately how much faster SKU can run a standard benchmark
	
	
Virtual Machines - MobileApp
	You can install the Azure Mobile App, and you can monitor your VMs on the go. 
	
	
Virtual Machines - VM Generations
	Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product. 
	It lets you create and run a software version of a computer, called a virtual machine
	Each virtual machine acts like a complete computer, running an opertating system and programs. 
		Hyper-V is just like Virtual Box
	There are two generations of Hyper-V VMs:
	Generation 1 - support most guest operating systems
	Generation 2 - support most 64-bit version of Windows and more current versions of Linux and FreeBSD operating systems
		Azure has Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs which are similar but not exactly the same as Hyper-V Generations
	The most important difference between Azure Gen 1 and Gen 2:
		Gen 1:
			BIOS-based architecture 
		Gen 2: 
			UEFI-based boot architecture (improved boot and installation times)
			Secure Boot verifies the boot loader is signed by a trusted authority
			Larger boot volume up to 64 TB
			Hyper-V VMs are packaged into Virtual Hard Disk Formats: VHD or VHDX files 
		
		
Virtual Machines - 3 Ways to Connect
	There are 3 ways to connecct to your Virtual Machines
		Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol to establish a secure connection between a client and a server. 
			This is how you can remotely connect to your Azure VM via terminal
			SSH happens on Port 22 via TCP
		Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection
			This is how you can remotely connect to a Windows Server via Visual Desktop 
			RDP happens on Port 3389 via TCP and UDP 
		Bastion
		Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure Portal. 
		It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TSL 
		A bastion is a hardened instance that is monitored. Users connect to this VM which then establishes a connection to the target instance. Sometimes known as a jump box since you have one extra security step. 
		
		
Virtual Machines - SSH
	It is a very common to use SSH key pairs as a means to authenticate to your VMs. 
	SSH Key Pairs is when you generate out two keys: 
		A private key
		A Public Key
	The private key should remain on your local system and not be shared with others. 
	The public key is stored on the VM. 
	When you go to SSH you provide your private key and its matched against the public key to authenticate you. 
	
	Example: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub azureuser@10.111.12.123
	
	
Virtual Machines - RDP
	In order to RDP into your Windows Server you'll need to download the RDP file. 
	The Remote Desktop Client is already installed in Windows 10. 
	If you are macOS you can download the Microsoft Remote Desktop from the Apple Store. 
		Once you open the RDP file you will use the Username and Password during the creation of your VM in the Azure Portal
		
		
Virtual Machines - Bastion
	Azure Bastion is an intermediate harden instance you can use to connect to your target server via SSH or RDP
	It will provision a Web based RDP client or SSH Terminal
	Some devices cannot run an RDP CLient such as Google Chromebook and so Azure Bastion is one of the only ways to allow you to do that
		When you create an Azure Bastion 
		You need to add a Subnet to your VNet called AzureBastionSubnet with at least a size of /27 (32 addresses)
	If you have a Windows Server which requires RDP, and have a Bastion in the same VNet 
	You just enter in your username and password as you normally would
	If you have a Linux server you can SSH with the Bastion 
	You can use SSH Private Keyh or Password that you set when you created your VM
	
	
Virtual Machines - Windows Vs Linux
	You can launch both Windows and Linux services on Azure VMs
		Windows 
			You need to Windows License (or your Windows account with by unactivated)
			You can bring your own license via Hybrid License
			you can set a username and password
			you have to use a much larger instance to run Windows at least a B2
			It's a full desktop environment
		Linux
			Most versions of Linux require no type of license
			You can set either a username and password or create an ssh-key pair 
			You can utilize smaller VM sizes because you're not running a full desktop experience
			Unix and Linux based system traditionally are terminal based environments 
			
			
Virtual Machines - Update Management 
	Update Management allows you to manage and install operating systems updates and patches for both Windows and Linux virtual machines that are deployed in Azure, on-premises, or in other cloud providers
	When you launch an azure vm you can go to Operations and turn on Guest + Host Updates. This will install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) that will install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) that will be used to monitor your instances
	Azure Automations is the underlying service that is installed the agent 
	Update Management will perform a scan for update compliance
	A compliance scan is by default, performed every 12 hours on a Windows and every 3 hours on a Linux 
	It can take between 30 minutes and 6 hours for the dashboard to display updated data from managed computers. 
		In Azure Automation, you can enable the Update Management, Change Tracking and Inventory, and Start/Stop VMs during off-hours features for your servers and virtual machines. These features have a dependency on a Log Analytics workspace, and therefor require linking the workspace with an Automation account. 
		
Azure Disks - Introduction
	A virtual hard drive in the cloud 
	Block-level storage volumes for SSD and HDD
	Azure Managed Disks are block-klevel storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure VMs
		Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized
		You specify the size, type and other configurations without worrying about underlying hardware 
	Managed disks are designed for 99.999% availability 
	Azure creates three replicas of your data, allowing for high durability 
	You can create up to 50,000 VM disks fo a type in a subscription per region 
	Allowing you to create up to 1000 VMs in a virtual machine scale set using a marketplace image 
	Managed disks are integrated with availability sets
	Managed disks support Availability Zones 
	Azure Backup can be used to create a backup job with time-based bacups and backup retention policies 
	you can use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to assign specific permissions for a managed disk to one or more users 
	You can directly import your Virtual Hard drive Disks (VHD) into Azure Disks 
	You can use Azure Private links to ensure traffic between Azure Disks and VMs stay within the Microsoft network 
	
	
Azure Disks - Encryption
	Azure Managed Disks supports 2 types of encryption: 
		Server Side Encryption (SSE) 
		Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)
	Server Side Encryption (SSE)
		Provides encryption-at-rest and safeguards your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. 
		enabled by default for all managed disks, snapshots, and images
		Temporary disk are not encrypted by server-side encryption unless you enable encryption at host
		Keys can be managed two ways: 
			Platform-managed keys - Azure manages your keys 
			Customer-Managed keys - You manage your keys 
	Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) 
		Allows you to encrypt the OS and Data disks by an IaaS Virtual Machine 
			For Windows encryption done by bitlocker 
			For Linux encryption is done by DM-Crypt
			
			
Azure Disks - Disk Roles
	There are 3 main disk roles in Azure, the data disk, the OS disk, the temporary disk 
		Data disk 
			a managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep 
			registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter you choose 
			has a maximum capacity of 32767 gibibytes (GiB)
			The size of a VM determines how many disks you can attach to the type of storage you can use
		OS Disk 
			Every virtual machine has one attaached operating system disk 
			That OS disk has a pre-installed OS, which was selected when the VM was created 
			This disk contains the boot volume
			This disk has a maximum capacity of 4095GB
		Temporary Disk 
			Most VMs contain a temporary disk, which is not a managed disk. 
			provides short-term storage for applications and processes, and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. 
			Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event  or when you redeploy a VM 
			During a succesful standard reboot of the VM, data on the temporary disk will persist 
			The temporary disk is typically /dev/sdb on Linux and Windows VMs the temporary disk is D: by default 
			not encryptedby SSE unless you enable encryption at host. 
			
			
Azure Disks - Managed Disk Snapshots Managed Custom Image
	A managed disk snapshot is a read-only crash-consistent full copy of a managed disk that is stored as a standard managed disk by default 
	Snapshots are point in time recovery 
	Snapshots exist independant of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks 
	Snapshots are billed based on the used size. (if you have a 64 GB drive and only use 10 GB you're only being billed the 10GB) 
	You can see the used size of your snapshots by looking at the Azure usage report. 
		A managed custom image allows you to create an image (a copy) of your disk from your VM
		This images contains all managed Disks associated with a VM, including both the OS and data disks. 
	A snapshot doesn't have awareness of any disk execept the one it contains 
	This makes it problematic to use in scenarios that require the coordination of multiple disks, such as striping 
	Snapshots would need to be able to coordinate with each other and this is currently not supported. 
	This is where you would want to use a Managed Custom Image. 
	
	
Azure Disks - Disk Types
	Azure offers 4 tiers of disks: 
		Ultra Disks 
			deliver high speed, high IOPS, and low latency disk storage for Azure VMs
			dynamically change the performace of the disk, without the need to restart your VM
			suited for a data-intensive workloads susch as SAP HANA, top tier databases, and transation-heavy workloads 
			can only be used as data disks (use a Premium SSD for OS Disk) 
			Only supported with very specific VM series 
		Premium SSD 
			high-performance and low-latency disk support for Azure VMs with input/output (IO) intensive workloads 
			suitable for mission-critical produciton applications 
			only be used with VM series that are premium storage compatible 
			Guaranteed IOPS, and throughput fo that disk (Standard tiers don't have IOPS guarantees) 
			designed to provide low single digit millisecond latencies and target IOPS and throughput described in the preceding table 99.9% of the time 
		Standard SSD
			cost effective storage option optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels

			Available ina ll Azure regions and can be used with Azure VMs 
		
Azure Disks - Bursting
	Disk Bursting is the ability to boost disk storage IOPS and MB/s performance for a period of time on both VMs and disks.
	Bursting allows you to handle unexpected disk traffic.
	This allows you to get more use out of your disk, avoid permanently upgrading to a more performance disk.
	Bursting on Disks and VMs are independent of one another.
	If you have a bursting disk you don’t need a bursting VM.
	Burstable VMs
		Lsv2 series (All Regions)
		Ds3 series (West Central US)
		Esv3 series (West Central US) 
	Bursting is enabled by default for virtual machines that support it.	
	Burstable Disk
		Premium SSDs for disk sizes P20 and smaller  (All Regions) 
	Bursting is enabled by default for disks that support it. 
	
	
Azure Application Gateway - Introduction to Application Gateway
	Azure Application Gateway is aplication-level routing and load balancing service. 
		Application Gateway operates on OSI layer 7 also known as the application layer 
		Aplication Gateway understandhow to work with HTTP/S requests 
		Advanced routing rules based on the contents of a request 
		Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) poloicies can be attached to an Application Gateway to provide additional security. 
		You need to configure a Frontends 
			Private IP will create an internal load balancer 
			Public IP will create a Public/ External load balancer 
			You need to configure a Backend
		You'll need to create backend pools 
			A backend pool is a collection of resources to which your application gateway can send traffic 
			A backend pool can contain: 
				virtual machines 
				virtual machines scale sets 
				IP addresses 
				domain names 
				App services 
		You need to configure Routing Rules 
			Listeners list to incoming traffic and passes it to rules 
			Rules say who should we pass data to 
			HTTP/S settings say how we should handle HTTP requests 
			
			
Azure Application Gateway - Routing Rules
	Listeners 
	A listener "listens" on a specified port and IP address for traffic that uses a specified protocol 
	If the listener criteria are met, the application gateway will apply the routing rule 
		There are 2 types of listeners: 
			Basic - forward all requests for any domain to backend pools 
			Multi site - forward requests to different backend pools based on host reader and host name 
			requests are matched according to the order of the rules and the type of listener 
				Add your basic listeners last otherwise it will capture all requests 
	Backend targets
		Chooses where a route should go either Backend Pool or Redirection 
	HTTP Settings 
		To create a rule for Backend Pool you need to create HTTP Setting. 
		This allows to define how we want to handle cookies, connection draining, port request time out and more 
	Backend Port 
		the port where the back-end servers listen to incoming traffic 
	Cookie-Based affinity 
		Use cookies to keep a user session on the same server 
	Connection draining
		gracefully remove backend pool members during planned service updates 
	Request Timeouts 
		the number of seconds that the application gateway will wait to receive a response from the backend pool before it returns a "connection timed out" error message 
	Override backend path 
		allows you to override the path in the URL so that the requests for a specific path can be routed to another path 
	Override Hostname
		Multi-tenant services like App service or API management rely on a specific host header or SNI extension to resolve the correct endpoint. Change these settings to overwrite the incoming HTTP host header 
		
		
Scale Sets - Introduction to Scale Sets
	Azure Scale Sets allows you to automatically increase or decrease your VM capacity
		Create Scaling Policies to automatically add or remove based on Host Metrics 
		Create Health Checks and set Repair Policy to replace unhealthy instances 
		Associate A Load Balancer to distribute BMs across AZs 
		You can scale to 100s or even 1000s of VMs using scale sets 
		A scale set is a group of identical VMs (same image and size) 
		
		
Scale Sets - Associate a Load Balancer
	A Load Balancer can be associated with a Scale Sets 
	This will allow you to: 	
		evenly distribute your VMs across multiple Availability Zones to make your application highly available 
		Use Load Balancer probe checks for more robust Health Checks 
	you have the choice between 2 different load balancers: 
		Application Gateway is an HTTP/HTTPS web traffic load balancer with URL-based routing, SSLL termination, session persistence, and web application firewall. 
		Azure Load Balancer supports all TCP/UDP network traffic, port-forwarding, and outbound flows. 
		
		
Scale Sets - Scaling Policy
	A Scaling Policy determines when a VMs should be added or removed to meet current capacity requirements
	Scale Out
	When a instance should be added to the Scale Set to increase capacity
		eg. When CPU Threshold (%) greater than X for Y minutes add X servers
	Scale In
		When a instance should be removed to the Scale Set to decrease capacity
		eg. When CPU Threshold (%) less than X for Y minutes add X servers
		When you are creating a Scale Set you have very limited options for your Scaling Policy
	After you create your ScaleSet you have a-lot more options available to configure the rules of your Scaling Policy
	Built-in Host-based metrics:
		Percentage CPU
		Network In
		Network Out
		Disk Read Bytes
		Disk Write Bytes
		Disk Read Operations/Sec
		Disk Write Operations/Sec
		CPU Credits Remaining
		CPU Credits Consumed 
	Aggregates
		Average
		Minimum
		Maximum
		Total
		Last
		Count 
	Operators
		Greater than
		Greater than or equal to
		Less than
		Less than or equal to
		Equal to
		Not equal to 
	Actions
		Increase count by X
		Increase percent by X%
		Increase count to X
		Decrease count by X
		Decrease percent by X%
		Decrease count to X 
	If you want more metrics there are 2 ways to collect more information:
	App Insights installs a small instrumentation package in your application that monitors the app and sends telemetry to Azure.
	When you want application metrics: Page load performance, Session counts 
	Azure Diagnostic extension is an agent that runs inside a VM instance. It monitors and saves performance metrics to Azure storage so you can collect more detailed information
	When you want more detailed Host-based metrics 
	Scale-In Policy is what determines what VM is removed (deleted) to decrease the capacity of the Scale Set
	Default
		Delete the VM with the highest Instance ID
		Balanced across Availability Zones (AZs) and Fault Domains (ADs) 
	Newest VM
		Delete the newest created VM
		Balanced across Availability Zones (AZs) 
	Oldest VM
		Delete the oldest VM
		Balanced across Availability Zones (AZs) 
	Update Policy determine how VM instances are brought up-to-date with the latest scale set model
		Automatic
			Increasing with start upgrading immediately in random order 
		Manual
			Existing instances must be manually upgraded 

		Rolling
			Upgrades roll out in batches with optional pause 
	Automatic OS upgrades can be enabled helps to ease update management by safely and automatically upgrading the OS disk for all instances
	
	
Scale Sets - Health Monitoring
	Health monitoring can be enabled to determine if your server is healthy or unhealthy 
	There are 2 modes of health monitoring
		Application health extension
			Ping an HTTP request to a specific path and except a status 200 
		Load balancer Probe
			Allow you to check based on TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests 
	Automatic repair policy 
		If an instance is found to be unhealthy the delete it and launch a new instance 
		
		
Scale Sets - Advanced Features 
	Allocation Policy 
		By default Scaling sets are limited to 100 instances 
		You can go beyond 100 (up to 1000 instances) 
	Proximity placement groups allow you to group Azure resources physically closer together in the same region
	by default a scale set has a single placement that hold up to 100 VMs
	If a scale set property called singlePlacementGroup is set to false, then the scale set can be composed of multiple placement groups and has a range of 0-1000 VMs 


Azure App Services - Introduction to Azure App Services 
	Azure App Service - Quickly deploy and manage Web Apps on Azure without worrying about the underlying infrastructure 
	Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends 
	you can choose your programming language and either a Windows or Linux Environment 
		It is a Platform as a Service, so it's the Heroku equivalent for Azure. 
	Azure App Services take scare of the following underlying infrastructure: 
		Security patches for OS and languages 
		Load balancing 
		Autoscaling
		Automated manager
	Azure App Service makes it easy to implement common integrations and featurs such as: 
		Azure DevOps (for deployments) 
		Github integration
		Docker Hub Integration
		Package Managment
		Easy to setup staging environments 
		Custom Domains 
		Attaching TLS/ SSL certificates 
	you pay based on an Azure App Service Plan: 
		Shared Tier - Free, Shared (Linux not supported) 
		Dedicated Tier - Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3
		Isolated Tier - Azure App Services can also run docker single or multi-containers
	When you create your app you have to choose a unique name since it becomes a fully qualified domain 


Azure App Services - Runtimes
	What is a Runtime Environment?
		A runtime software/ instructions that are executed while your program is running. 
		A runtime generally means what programming language and libraries and framework you are using. 
	A runtime for Azure App Services will be a pre-defilned container that has your programming language and commonly used library for that language installed. 
		With Azure App Services you choose a runtime 
			.NET 
			.NET Core
			Java
			Ruby
			Node.js
			PHP
			Python
		Azure App services will have generally multiple latest verisons of a programming language eg. Ruby 2.6, 2.7
		Its common for a cloud provider to stop supporting older versions so you keep current and forces customer to keep good security practices by having latest patches. 

	 
Azure App Services - Custom Containers
	Azure App Service allows you defined custom containers for Windows or Linux
	You might want to create your own custom container to use a different runtime or bundle in packages or software 
		Create your own Docker Container on your local environment 
		Push the Docker container to Azure Container Registry
		Deploy your Container Image to App Service


Azure App Services - Deployment Slots
	Deployments Slots allow you to create different environments of your web-application associated to a different hostname. This is useful when need a staging, QA environment. 
	Think of it as a way to quickly clone your production environment for other uses. 
	You can also Swap enviroments this could be how you perform a Blue/Green Deploy. 
	you can promote our staging to production by swapping, if something goes wrong you could swap them back. 


Azure App Services - App Service Environment
	App Services Environment (ASE) is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale
		This allows you to host: 
			Windows web apps 
			Linux web apps 
			Docker containers 
			Mobile Apps
			Functions
		App Service Environments (ASEs) are appropriate for applicatoin workloads that require: 
			Very high scale
			Isolation and secure network access
			High memory utilization
	Customers can create multiple ASEs within a single Azure region or across multiple Azure Regions making ASEs ideal for horizontally scaling stateless application tiers in support of high request per second (RPS) workloads. 
		ASE comes with its own pricing tier (Isolated Tier) 
		ASEs can be used to configure security architecture 
		Apps running on ASEs can have their access gated by upstream devices, such as web application firewalls (WAFs)
		App Service Environments can be deployed into Availability Azones (AZ) using zone pinning
			There are 2 deployment types for an App Service environement (ASE):
				External ASE 
				ILB ASE
			External ASE exposes the ASE-hosted apps on an internet-accessible IP address
			ILB ASE exposes the ASE-hosted apps on an IP address inside your VNET. 
			The internal endpoint is an internal load balancer (ILB)
