Azure Active Directory
	Cloud-Based identity and access management service. 
	Manage users, Sign-Ins and access to AD-related resources

Domain
	A domain is an area of a network organized by a single authentication database
	An Active Directory Domain is a logical grouping of AD objects on a network 

Domain Controller (DC)
	A domain controller is a server that authenticates users identities and authorizes their access to resources 
	
Domain Computer
	A computer that is registered wiht a central authentication database A domain computer would be an AD Object 
	
AD Object
	An AD Object is the basic element of Active Directory such as: 
		Users, Groups, Printers, Shared Folders

Group Policy Object
	A virtual collection fo policy settings. It controls what AD objects have access to. 
	
Organization Units (OU)
	A subdivision within Active Directory into which you can place users, groups, computers, and other organizational units. 
	
Directory Service
	A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. A Directory service on a Domain Controller
	
Azure AD - Tenant
	A tenant represents an organization in Azure Active Directory
	A tenant is a dedicated Azure AD Server Instance 
	A tenant is automatically created when you sign up for either
		Microsoft Azure
		Microsoft Intue
		Microsoft 365

Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
	Azure Active Direcotry Domain Services (AD DS) provides managed domain service such as: 
		Domain Joins
		Group Policies
		LDAP (Lightweight Directory access protocol)
		Kerberos / NTLM Authentication
		
Azure AD Connect 
	Azure AD Connect is a hybrid service to connect your on-premise Active Directory to your Azure Account
	Azure AD Connect allows for seamless Single Sign On from your on-premise workstation to Microsoft Azure 
	Azure AD Connect has the following features: 
		
		Password hash synchronization - sign-in method, synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD passwords with Azure AD
		
		Pass-through authentication - sign-in method, allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud
		
		Federation Integration - hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure, for certificate renewal
		
		Synchronization - Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects, ensures on-prem and cloud data matches
		
		Health Monitoring - robust monitoring and provides a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity
		
Active Directory - Users
	Users represent an identity for a person or employee in your domain. A user has logon credentials and can use them to log into the Azure Portal 
		You can assign roles and administrative roles to users 
		You can add users to groups 
		You can enforce authentication methods such as (MFA) 
		You can track users sign ins 
		Track devices user's login from and allow or deny devices 
		Assign Microsoft licenses
		
		Azure AD has two kinds of users: 
			Users - A user belongs to your organization
			Guest Users - A guest user belongs to another organization
		
Azure AD Groups	
	Groups - lets the resource owner (of Azure directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group, instead of having to provide the rights one-by-one. 
	Groups contain: 
		Owners - Has permissions to add and remove members 
		Members - Have permissions to do things 
	Assignment 
		You can assign roles directly to a group 
		You can assign applications directly to a group
		
		Request to Join Groups
			The group owner can let userse find their own groups to join, instead of assigning them. The owner can also set up the group to automatically accept all users that joinor to require approval. 	
		
Azure AD - Assign Access Rights
	There are four ways to assign resource access rights to yoru users: 
		Direct Assignment - The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource
		Group Assignment - The resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which automatically gives all of the group members acceess to the resource 
		
		Rule-based Assignment - The resource owner creates a group and uses a role to define which users are assigned to a specific resource
		 
		 External Authority Assignment - Accesss comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app. 
		 
Azure AD - External Identities 
	External Identities in Azure AD, allow people outside your organization to access your apps and resources, while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer.
		
		Supports logins from Google and Facebook
		Share Apps with external users (B2B COllaboration)
		Develop Apps intended for other Azure AD tenants (single tenant or multi tentant) 
		Develop white-labeled apps for consumers and customers (Azure AD B2C) 
	
Azure AD - Device Management 
	What is Device Identify Management? 
		The management of a physical devices such as phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers, that are granted access to company resources such as Printers, Cloud Resources via device-based Conditional Access. 	
	
		For companies with a distributed workforce, that allows remote employedes and employees who are allowed use their own personal equipment (Bring Your Own Device).
		
		A company needs a way to protect their organization's assets such as access to cloud resoures across those devices where they have less control over the physical securities of the work environment.

Azure Policies - Azure Policy Definition File
	Display Name - Identifies the policy (128 character limit) 
	Type (read only )
		Built in - maintained by Michaelsoft 
		Custom - Created by you
		Static - Microsoft Owned, A regulatory Compliance
	Description - Provides the context of the policy 
	Metadata - Optional key value information to store on the policy
	Mode - Determines which resource types are evaluated. Changes whether using resource provider or Azure Resource Manager 
		Resource Manager 
			All - resource groups, subscriptions and all resource types
			Indexed - only resource types that support tags and location
		Resource Provider
			Microsoft.ContainerService.Data
			Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data
			Microsoft.KeyVault.Data
		Parameters - Values you can pass into the policy to allow the policy to be more flexible. A parameter has the following properties 
			Name - the name of the parametere 
			Type - string, array, object, boolean, integer, float or datetime
			Metadata - used by azure to display friendly information
				description
				display name 
				strong type 
				assign permissions
			defaultvalue
			allowevalues
	Policy Rule
		consists of an if and then blocks. In the if block, you define one or more conditions that specify when the policy is enforced. You can apply logical operators to these conditions to precisely define the scenario for a policy 
		Deny - the resource creation / update fails due to policy
		Audit - Creates a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant resource but it doesn't stop the request 
		Append - Adds additional parameters/ fields to the requested resource during creation or update. A common example is adding tags on resources such as Cost Center or specifying allowec IPs for a storage resource. 
		Audit if not exists - creates a warning event in the activity log when evaluating a non-compliant resource, but it doesn't stop the request 
		Deploy if not exists - Executes a template deployment when specific condition is met. for example if SQL encryption is enabled on a database, then it can run a template after the DB is created to set it up a specific way. 
		Disabled - The policy is ignored (disabled). Oftern used for testing 
		
		
Azure Resource Manager - Azure Resource Manager 
	A deployment and management service for Azure
	Enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your azure account
Azure Resource Manager - Introduction
	Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a service that allows you to manager Azure resources
		Azure Resource Manager is a collection of services in the Azure Portal, so you can't simply type in "Azure Resource Manager" 
	It is a management layer that allows you to: 
		Create, Update, Delete Resources
		Apply Management features eg. Access Controls, Locks, Tags
		Writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via JSON templates. 
			The specific features we are going to look at that make up ARM layer are the following: 
				Subscriptions
				Management Groups
				Resource Groups
				Resource Providers 
				Resource Locks
				Azure Blueprints
				Resources Tags
				Access Control 
				Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) 
				Azure Policies 
				ARM Templates 
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Use Case
	Think of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) as a gate keeper. 
	All requests flow through ARM and it decides whether that request can be performed on a resource. 
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Scoping
	What is scope? 
	Scope is a boundary of control for azure resources. it is a way to governyou resource by placing resources 
		within a logical grouping 
		and also applying a logical restriction in the form of rules 
		
	Management Groups - A logical grouping of multiple subscriptions 
		Subsciptions - grants you access to Azure services based on a billing and support agreement
			Resource Groups - a logical grouping of multiple resources 
				Resources - an azure service eg. Azure VM's 
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Subscriptions
	Before you can do anything in your Azure account. You'll need to have a subscription. An Azure Account can have multiple subscriptions and the most common three are: 
		Free Trial 
		Pay as you go 
		Azure for Students 
	At the subscription level you'll have the ability to set: 
		Resource Tags
		Access Controls
		Resource Groups
		
		
Azure Resource Manager - Management Groups
	Managing multiple subscriptions (accounts) into a hierarchal structure. 
	Each directory is given a single top level management group called the "root" management group
	All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Groups
	Resource Groups - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution
	Resource - A manageable item that is available through Azure 
	Resourece Provider - A service that supplies Azure resources
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Providers
	Resource Providers - In order to use Azure resources you have to register Resourec Providers
	Many Resource Providers are registered by default for you with you Subscription
	You can register resource providers under your subscription
	
	
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Tags
	A tag is a key and value pair that you can assign to azure resources. 
		Tags allow you to organize your resources in the following ways: 
			Resource management 
				Specific workloads, environments eg. Developer environments 
			Cost management and optimization
				Cost tracking, budgets, alerts 
			Operations Managment 
				Business commitments and SLA operations eg. Mission critical services 
			Security 
				Classification of data and security impact
			Governance and regulatory compliance
			Automation
			Workload optimization
			
			
Azure Resource Manager - Resource Locks
	As an admin, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other userse from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. 
		In the Azure portal you can set the following lock levels 
			Cannot delete 
				authorized users can still read and modify a resource but they cant delete the resource 
			ReadOnly
				authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resources 		
				
				
Azure Resource Manager - Azure Blueprints	
	Azure blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions. 
	Compose artifacts based on common organization-based patterns into re-usable blueprints. 
	The service is designed to help with environment setup
	Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as: 
		Role Assignments
		Policy Assignments 
		Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM Templates) 
		Resource Groups
			The Azure Blueprints service is backed by the globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB 
			Blueprint objects are replicated to multiple Azure regions. 
		ARM Templates vs Azure Blueprints 
			Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Azure Blueprints can be accomplished with an ARM template
			ARM Template
				ARM templateds are stored either locally or in source control
				There no active connection or relationship to the ARM template 
			Azure Blueprints 
				relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) 
		Azure Blueprints supports improved tracking and auditing of deployments 
		
		
ARM Templates - Introduction 
	What is Infrastructure as Code? (IaC) 
		the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers (eg. Azure) through machine-readable definition files (eg. JSON files) rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 
		You write a script that will setup cloud services for you. 
		IaCs can either be: 
			Declarative - You defined exactly what you want, and you get exactly that
			Imperative - You define what you generally want, and the service will guess what you want. 
	ARM Templates are JSON files that define azure resources you want to provision and azure services you want to configure 
		With ARM templates you can: 
			ARM templates are declarative: (you get exctly what you define)
			stand up, tear down or share entire architectures in minutes
			Reduce configuration mistakes 
			Know exactly what you have defined for a stack to establish an architecture baseline for compliance 
	With ARM templates you can: 
		ARM teplates are declarative. (you get exactly what you define) 
		stand up, tear down or share entire architecture in minutes
		Reduce configuration mistakes 
		Establish an architecture baseline for compliance 
		Modulatrity break up your architecture in multiple files and reuse them
		Extensibility Add Powershell and Bash scripts to your templates 
		Testing you can use the ARM template tool kit (arm-ttk)
		Preview Changes Before you create infrastructure via template, see what it will create
		Built-In Validation will only deploy your template if it passes 
		Tracked Deployments Keep track of changes to architecture over time
		Policy as Code Apply Azure policies to ensure you remain compliant
		Microsoft Blueprints (establishes relationship between resource and the template) 
		CI/CD Integration
		Exportable Code (exporting the current state of resource groups and resources)
		Authoring tools Visual Studio Code has advanced features for authoring ARM templates 
		
		
ARM Templates - Arm Template Skeleton
	Skeleton - the genreal structure of an ARM template 
	$schema - describes the properties that are avaialable within a template. 
	contentVersion - the version of the template. 
		You can provide any value for this element
	apiProfile - Use this value to avoiid having to specify API versions for each resource in the template 
	parameters - values you can pass along to your template 
	variables - you transform parameters or resource properties using function expressions
	Functions - User-defined functions available within template 
	resources - the azure resources you'll want to deploy or update 
	outputs - values that are returned after deployment 
	
	
ARM Templates - ARM Template Resources 
	Resource - An Azure Resource you want to provision
		type - type of the resources
			Follows the format of {ResourceProvider}/ResourceType
		apiVersion - Version of the REST API to use for the resource
			Each resource provider published its own API versions, 
		name - Name of the resource
		location - Most resources have a location property
			The region where the resource will be deployed
		Other Properties - Other properties we can use to configure the resource
		Will vary per resource type
		
		
ARM Templates - Parameters
	Parameters - Allows you to pass variables to your ARM template
	type - the expected data type of the inputed value 
		string,securestring, int, bool, object, securedObject, and array.

ARM Templates - ARM Template Variables 
	Nested Variables - You can use json object to have nested variables to scope your variables for multiple use cases. 
	Scoping / Nesting variables based on environment
		"variables": {
		  "environmentSettings": {
		    "test": {
		      "instancesize": "Small", 
		      "instanceCount": 4
		    }
		  }
		},

		    "type": "string", 
		    "allowedValues": [
		      "test", 
		      "prod"
		    ]
		  }
		},
	Referencing nested variables eg Variables()[].property
		"[variables('environmentSettings')[parameters('environmentName')].instanceSize]" 


ARM Templates - ARM Templates Outputs
	Outputs - Returns values from deployed resources, so you can use them programmatically
	You specify the type and value under outputs
		"outputs": { 
		  "resourceID": {
		    "type": "string",
		    "value": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses', parameters('publicIPAddressses_name'))]"
	You can use the Azure API via CLI, Powershell or SDK to fetch outputs 
	
	
Storage Accounts - Introduction to Storage Accounts 
	Azure Storage Accounts - Contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks
	Azure Storage offers several types of stroage accounts. 
	Each with different features and their own pricing models 
		General-purpose v1 (legacy)
		General-purpose v2
		BlobStorage (legacy)
		BlockBlobStorage
		File Stroage
	Storage Accounts vary with the following features: 
		Supported Services (What can I put in this storage account?)
			Blob, File, Queue, Table, Disk, and Data Lake Gen2
		Performance Tiers (how fast will my read and writes be?)
			Standard and Premium
		Access Tiers (how often do I need quick access to files?)

			LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS
		Deployment Model (Who should deploy the supported services?)
			Resource Manager, Classic
			
	
Storage Accounts - Storage Comparison
	General-purpose V2 is the most common storage type aside from Blob Storage
Storage Accounts - Core Storage Services
	 Azure has 5 core storage services 
	 	Azure Blob - A massively scalable objecty store for text and binary data.
	 		Also included support for Big Data Analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen 2
	 	Azure Files - Managed file shares for on-premises deployments
	 	Azure Queues - A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components 
	 	Azure Tables - a NoSQL store for schema-less storage of structured data
	 	Azure Disks = Block level storage volumes for Azure VM's 
	 	
	 	
Storage Accounts - Performance Tiers
	Ther are 2 types of performance tiers for storage accounts: Standard and Premium 
		IOPS - stands for input / Output operations per second 
		Premium Performance
			Stored on Solid State Drives 
			Optimize for low latency
			Higher throughput
			use cases: 
				Interactive Workloads
				Analytics
				AI or ML 
				Data Transformation
			An SSD has no moving parts and data is distributed randomly. This is why it can read and write so fast 
		Standard Performance
			Stored on Hard Disk Drives 
			Varied performance based on access tier (Hot, Cool, Archive) 
			Use Cases: 
				Backup and disaster recovery
				Media Content
				Bulk Data Processing
			An HDD has moving parts, an arm that needs to read and write data sequential to a disk. It is very good at writing or reading large amounts of data that is close together.
